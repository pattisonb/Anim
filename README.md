Our development team has worked hard to ensure that the application is generally easy and straightforward to use.
When opening the application on an IOS device, the user will first be taken to the login page. Here they can either
enter their credentials and login or register a new account. After using the button below the text fields, the user
will be taken to the profile view page. This page will display the user image as well as their email. At the bottom,
the user can use the icon buttons to switch between their profile and the product view. Once on the product view they
can either use the scan or search button to access the barcode scanning feature or the search feature. The scan works
by accessing the camera and allowing the user to take a photo. Once they hit the “Take Photo” button, they can use the
“Use Photo” button to then be taken back to the product view where they will see the product linked to their sent
barcode. Alternatively, the search button can be used to search for a product by name. In the text field, the user can
enter the name of the product and then once they have done so they can use the search button. This will take them back
to the product view where they will be able to see the product name, image, and information.

Below is a LINK that will show you a demo of the application on an IOS device.
